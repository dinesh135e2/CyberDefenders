You acquired a disk image and found that Karen uses Linux OS on her machine. Analyze the disk image of Karen's computer and answer the provided questions.

Walkthrough:

Use FTK imager to mount the downloaded AD1 image and follow along the walkthrough

#1	What distribution of Linux is being used on this machine?
Ans:	Kali linux distribution – this is found in the boot directory of the linux file system when you mount the given AD1 image in FTK imager. Note: boot directory stores the kernel and init files of the distribution that will help in boot up process.

#2	What is the MD5 hash of the apache access.log?
Ans:	d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e – go to the location of apache access log file (var->apache2->access.log), right click on the access.log file and export file hash list to the desired location on your computer. This will give the md5 and sha1 hash of the file in csv format.

#3	It is believed that a credential dumping tool was downloaded? What is the file name of the download?
Ans:	mimikatz_trunk.zip – can be found in downloads folder of root user account.

Ans:	irZLAohL.jpeg – can be found in root folder.

Ans:	/root/Documents/myfirsthack/ - as question suggests, this can be found from the bash history file.
